# Super Dynamic Server

A reusable, super-dynamic server template built with Express, Webpack, Gulp, and other tools for hosting single-page applications (SPA) with vanilla JavaScript, React, or other frameworks. It supports hot module reloading (HMR), SCSS compilation, and easy Node module imports on the front end.

## Features

- **Express** for serving the application.
- **Webpack** for bundling JavaScript and CSS.
- **Gulp** for automating SCSS compilation to CSS.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** with Webpack for instant updates in development.
- **Support for Vanilla JavaScript, React, and other frameworks**.
- **Reusable** template for quick setup in future projects.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/super-dynamic-server.git
    cd super-dynamic-server
    npm install


### To Start the Development Server
    npm start
This will start the server and watch for changes in the src directory. It will also automatically recompile SCSS files and trigger hot module replacement for JavaScript and CSS.

### To Build for Production
    npm run build
This will create a dist folder with the bundled JavaScript and CSS, ready to be served in a production environment.

### Customization
To add additional SCSS files, create them in the src/scss directory and include them in main.scss.
To use React components, add your components in the src directory and update index.js to render them.
To add more Gulp tasks, edit gulpfile.js as needed.
Example Usage
You can modify src/index.js for your preferred framework:

Using Vanilla JavaScript
```
import './css/main.css';
document.getElementById('root').innerHTML = '<h1>Hello Entry File!</h1>';
```
Using React
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './css/main.css';

const App = () => <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);

root.render(<App />);
```
